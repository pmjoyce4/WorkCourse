Requires my PanZoomBox control to work

This is a complete C# rewrite based on erksartori's Coursedrawer.

I'm hoping to get significant stability improvements by using a (imho) slightly saner display control and migrating the XML storage
to the .NET XmlSerializer. Also looking to include a few new features, such as automatic MPH/KPH conversion and maybe some other
quality of life improvements.
